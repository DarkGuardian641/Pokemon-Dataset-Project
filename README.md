# [Practicing filtering sorting with Pokemon](https://profiles.datawars.io/atharvab641/projects/54b07e96-f0da-4b5d-ba40-c87475e42b8e)

This project is about Querying and Filtering Pokemon data.
The project analyzes a dataset containing detailed information about 1,104 Pok√©mon, exploring their types, attributes, and distributions using Python. 
The analysis also answers a set of structured questions to derive insights into their abilities and characteristics.

## üåü About the project

we explore the dataset using Python's pandas library and its core methods:

- `df.loc`: For label-based indexing.

- `df.iloc`: For position-based indexing.

- `df.query`: For filtering with boolean conditions.

- `df.sort_values`: For sorting data by column values.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries:
  `pandas`,
   `numpy`,
  `matplotlib`
- The provided Pokemon.csv file containing the dataset.
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE that supports .ipynb files.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

- Clone or download this repository.
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed:
```python3
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
- Open the pokemon.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
- Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
